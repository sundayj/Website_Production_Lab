# Website_Production_Lab
In the Midlands TechHire program, this project was a final culmination of everything we had learned throughout the front-end development program. Started and completed from scratch, we followed directions out of small book to complete a "five page" website for Adventures Insurance. Due to the length of the directions in the book, I will not include of them in this repository, but I will try to describe the main objectives in this "README" file. We were given three days to complete this project.
<br/>
I received the grade of "A." 
<br/>
<br/>
For the Home page (index), we were given basic instructions like font-family, size, height and width dimensions, etc. In the Header, we were told to make the navigation list items italicize when hovered over, and to not be bulletted or underlined. We were told to the make the articles in the middle of the page to float next to each other, and for there to be a line in between the two articles. For the image "Lines of Business," we were told that, when clicked, the button should perform a javascript function that creates four individual alerts that shared different pieces of information. The image was also supposed to turn the cursor into a pointer when hovered over. For the Footer section, we were told to create a small inline JS function to show the current year in the copyright, and to add a FaceBook image as a social media "link." Finally, we were told to add meaningful alt tags, titles, and meta description tags for each page, as well as a meaningful title element to each page.
<br/>
<br/>
For the Contact page, we were supposed to use the Home page as a template, then we were given the following directions:
<p>In the following phase, you will create a contact us page, a contact form, apply additional CSS components, and an additional JavaScript function that returns information to the user in the form of a pop-up when the hit the submit button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the form to look as much like the screen print as possible (not included in the repository). You may need to use classes to format the labels and the form fields.</li>
<li>Use labels for everything, not just plain text, using all of the HTML5 rules learned from the HTML5 class.</li>
<li>Make the first name, last name, email address all required per HTML5.</li>
<li>Per the screen print, show the user what information should be typed into the last name, email, and comments fields.</li>
<li>The cursor should initially show up in the first name field.</li>
<li>Use the correct HTML5 elements for the email and phone fields.</li>
<li>Style the page appropriately with the correct spacing per the screen prints; use classes on all tags, or use type selectors, no inline styling. Use multiple classes on each element if necessary.</li>
<li>The JavaScript function should check to see that one of the boxes (email or phone) is checked.</li>
<li>The JavaScript function should check to see that ONLY one of the boxes (email or phone) is checked.</li>
<li>Once the checks are correct; the pop up should alert the user (by name) that they will be contacted in the way that they chose on the site.</li>
<li>In the form, use the action of http://severien.com/grit/formecho.php in order to check the form functionality.</li>
<li>Use a return value of false inside of your JavaScript function so as not to submit the form if the validation fails.</li>
<li>Use the event handler, not the listener.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
For the About Us page, we were supposed to use the home page a tempplate, but then any extra styling was supposed to be done in a way that didn't effect the CSS of any other page. For instance, we were supposed to add additional styling to the nav list without it effecting the nav lists on the other two pages, like having the nav turn blue when hovered and the font-size to grow over a .25s period without causing the "Contact" list item to wrap strangely. For the middle of the body, we were instructed to not use any extra divs, but to make everything wrap according to a screen shot, and to give the image a slight rotation and rotation transition when hovered. Also, for the About page only, we were to give the headings a new font-style using a woff file.
<br/>
<br/>
For Responsive Design, we were told to "use media query for two different screen sizes - 900 px and 450px.
<br/>
For the 900px media query:
<ul>
<li>Resize the logo image to 400px; it should still be centered in the header.</li>
<li>Hide the main image of the petting zoo.</li>
<li>Resize the header to 400px; reduce the height to fit the new menu.</li>
<li>List items - reconfigure these completely - ovverride padding, margins, width, and make them "stack" on top of each other.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust widths or adjust heights on other items so that the horizontal scroll bar disappears as you resize the browser: middlediv - change to a percentage, as well as change the footer to a percentage.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
For the 450px media query:
<ul>
<li>Resize the logo image to 200px wide - keep it centered.</li>
<li>Resize the header to 300px wide - what do you need to override to make the top image bar go away/disappear? (hint - there was an image in the header...)</li>
<li>Resize the roller coaster image appropriately as well.</li>
</ul>
