In the Midlands TechHire program, this project was a final culmination of everything we had learned throughout the front-end development program. Started and completed from scratch, we followed directions out of small book to complete a "five page" website for Adventures Insurance. Due to the length of the directions in the book, I will not include them in this repository, but I will try to describe the main objectives in the descriptions of each file, respectively. We were given three days to complete this project.

I received the grade of "A."
